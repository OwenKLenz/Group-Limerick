# Group Limerick

### Preface
This is my first attempt at crafting an original web application. The back end is built Ruby using the Sinatra framework and the front end is built with with my underdeveloped skills in HTML and CSS.

I'm building this while sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic and my hope it is that the game might be a fun diversion for family and friends during these difficult times.

### What is a limerick?
As defined on [literarydevices.net](http://literarydevices.net/limerick):
*Limerick is a comic verse, containing five anapestic (unstressed/unstressed/stressed) lines, in which the first, second, and fifth lines are longer, rhyme together, and follow three metrical feet. The third and fourth lines rhyme together, are shorter, and follow two metrical feet. However, sometimes it may vary, and amphibrachic (unstressed/stressed/unstressed) form can replace anapestic. In fact, it is a bawdy, humorous, or nonsensical verse written in the form of five anapests, with an aabba rhyme scheme. Since it has a special structure and format, it is called fixed or closed form of poetry.*

- The bawdier and more uncouth, the better.

### What is Group Limerick?
A delightful game that can be played with 2-5 people. Each person concocts the first line of a limerick and then passes the limerick to the person next to them. This process repeats until the limerick is finished at which point the results are read aloud and heary laughs are shared.
