## How to Play

- Group Limerick is played with a group of 2-5 players, preferably with the aid of a voice or video chat app such as [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). This way, slower players can be heckled mercilessly for taking too long to come up with their next line. Additionally, the often inane and innapropriate results can be enjoyed together.

- After assembling a group of friends, one player should create a [new game](/new_game).

- Once created, other players can [join](/join) the game.

- After all players have joined and the group is full, press the refresh button to enter the first limerick line.

- Once each player has finished their line, each limerick is passed around to a new player who writes the 2nd line.

- Rinse and repeat until all limericks are complete.

## About the Limerick

A time honored poetic tradition, the limerick is described thus on [poets.org](http://poets.org/glossary/limerick):

- *Typically, the first two lines rhyme with each other, the third and fourth rhyme together, and the fifth line either repeats the first line or rhymes with it. The limerick's [anapestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapaest) rhythm is created by an accentual pattern that contains many sets of double weakly-stressed syllables. The pattern can be illustrated with dashes denoting weak syllables, and back-slashes for stresses:*

>1. -/ - - / - - /

>2. -/ - - / - - /

>3. -/ - - /

>4. -/ - - /

>5. -/ - - / - - /

#### Example:

>*The limerick packs laughs anatomical*

>*In space that is quite economical*

>*But the good ones I've seen*

>*So seldom are clean*

>*And the clean ones so seldom are comical.*
