## How to Play

- Group Limerick is played with a group of 2-5 players. 

- The game begins with each player crafting the first line of a limerick. Once each player has finished their line, limericks are passed around to a new player who writes the 2nd line, and so on until all limericks are complete. The game is best played over group voice or video chat so that slower players can be heckled mercilessly for taking too long to come up with their next line. Additionally, the often inane and innapropriate results can be enjoyed together.

## About the Limerick

A time honored poetic tradition, the limerick is described thus on [poets.org](http://poets.org/glossary/limerick) ~

- *Typically, the first two lines rhyme with each other, the third and fourth rhyme together, and the fifth line either repeats the first line or rhymes with it. The limerick's [anapestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapaest) rhythm is created by an accentual pattern that contains many sets of double weakly-stressed syllables. The pattern can be illustrated with dashes denoting weak syllables, and back-slashes for stresses:*

>1. -/ - - / - - /

>2. -/ - - / - - /

>3. -/ - - /

>4. -/ - - /

>5. -/ - - / - - /

**Example:**

>*The limerick packs laughs anatomical*

>*In space that is quite economical*

>*But the good ones I've seen*

>*So seldom are clean*

>*And the clean ones so seldom are comical.*
